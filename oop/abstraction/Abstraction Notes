Abstraction id about hiding internal impl from outside users, only the functionoality will be provided to the user.
In other words, users will have the information on what the object does, instead of how it does.
Advantage - security
It can be achieved by using - abstract class, interface

INTERFACE:
it is a blueprint of a class 
it contains static var, abstract mtds
variables are by default -> public, static, final
methods are by default -> public abstract
it is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance
it cannot be instantiated like abstract class
since java8, we can have static and default methods
since java8, we can have private methods
interface provides loose coupling

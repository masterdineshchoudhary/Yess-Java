JDBC : Java Database Connectivity
	JDBC is Java API which helps java program to connect with the database
	JDBC Driver - converts JDBC specific call into database specific call
	
	Types :
		Type 1 driver : JDBC-ODBC driver
		Type 2 driver : Native driver
		Type 3 driver : Native Protocol driver
		Type 4 driver : Thin driver
		
	JDBC follows 5 steps to connect to the database
		1. Register the Driver class with Driver Manager class using forName() method of class class
		2. Create Connection - using getConnection() method of Driver Manager class
		3. Create Statement - using createStatement() method of Connection class
		4. Execute query - executeQuery() method will be called on Statement object - returns an ResultSetInterface object
		
		// (I) Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(); -> returns connection (con)
		// (I) Statement s = con.createStatement();
		// (I) ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery("Select * from emp");
		
		ResultSet will create an exact copy of table, but will replace col names by its data types
		
	
	Using JDBC, we can perform CRUD operations :
		1. Create
		2. Read
		3. Update
		4. Delete
